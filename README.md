# drf_reader

Script for processing raw Daily Racing Form files (https://www1.drf.com/formulator/userguide.pdf) attributing and notating properties I personally find useful, e.g. class relief, winning previous race, top rated jockey etc.

Example usage

$./python drf_reader2.py path_to/Gp_220206/Gp_220206
